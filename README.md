# Robux-Into-USD (This script might ask for permissions.)
This script is open source and is completely safe.
I tried to make this very accurate, and I think I did a good job.
# Tampermonkey only!
[Download Tampermonkey from web store here.](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?)
# Installation
1. [Download the Tampermonkey web extension.](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?)
2. After installing Tampermonkey, press on it's icon and press "Add new script"
3. Copy the .js and paste it right in.
4. Save (Ctrl+s)
# After installation
1. Allow permissions, if it asks.
2. That's all, now your robux and USD is shown at the right top of your screen.
(I recommend using dark mode it may be mandatary otherwise it's hard to read.)
